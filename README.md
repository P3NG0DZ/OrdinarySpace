## How to Run

### Running in Python

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Running the Script**:
   - **Run as Administrator**: It is highly recommended to run the script with administrator privileges to ensure it has the necessary permissions to perform system operations.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the script using Python with administrator rights:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
     - On Windows, you can open Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator and then run the above command.

### Running as an Executable (EXE)

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have the `dist` directory in your project folder.
   - Locate the `OrdinarySpace.exe` file inside the `dist` directory.

2. **Running the Executable**:
   - **Run as Administrator**: Always run the executable with administrator privileges to ensure it can perform system-level operations.
   - Right-click the `OrdinarySpace.exe` file and select "Run as administrator".
   - Alternatively, you can run it from the command line with elevated privileges:
     ```bash
     ./dist/OrdinarySpace.exe
     ```
     - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator and then run the above command.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Defender Marks the EXE as a Virus

Windows Defender or other antivirus software might flag the executable as a potential threat due to its file manipulation capabilities. Hereâ€™s what you can do:

1. **Add an Exception**:
   - Open Windows Defender.
   - Go to "Virus & threat protection" > "Manage settings" > "Exclusions".
   - Add the `OrdinarySpace.exe` file or the entire `dist` directory as an exclusion.

2. **Verify the Source**:
   - Ensure that the executable was downloaded from a trusted source or built from the provided source code.

3. **Run as Administrator**:
   - Always run the executable with administrator rights to ensure it has the necessary permissions to perform system operations.
